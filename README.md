## Viewability best practices
<https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6199883?hl=en>
### Ad placement
There are three criteria that must be met before an ad impression is counted as viewable.

* A user must navigate to an area of the page where 50% of the ad’s pixels are visible in the browser window.
* The user must pause or proceed slowly enough that the ad is on screen for 1 continuous second. Scrolling past an ad too quickly does not count.
* The ad must be rendered when the user navigates to it.
